# **Python Assignment: Echo and Fibonacci Programs**

## **Introduction**
This project has two simple Python programs:  
1. `echo.py` to create a fading echo effect.  
2. `fib.py` to compute Fibonacci numbers using recursion and measure the time taken.

---

## **Part 1: echo.py**

### **What it does:**
The `echo.py` program simulates a fading echo of the input text.

### **How it works:**
- Takes a word or sentence as input.
- Repeats the last few characters, fading out with each step.

### **Example Output:**
```sh
$ python echo.py
Yell something at a mountain: Hello
llo
lo
o
```

---

## **Part 2: fib.py**

### **What it does:**
The `fib.py` program calculates the Fibonacci sequence and measures how long each calculation takes.

### **How it works:**
- Uses recursion to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
- Measures and displays the time taken for each calculation.

### **Example Output:**
```sh
$ python fib.py

```

### **Plot Output:**
The program creates a plot (`fib_timing_plot.png`) showing how long it took to compute each Fibonacci number.

## **How to Run**
1. Run `echo.py` to see the echo effect:
   ```sh
   python echo.py
   ```
2. Run `fib.py` to calculate Fibonacci numbers and generate the timing plot:
   ```sh
   python fib.py
   ```
